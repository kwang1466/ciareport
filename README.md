# ciareport
change impact analysis report from CAST AIP database

# how to run
python ciareport.py -o "d:\Reports" -h localhost -p 2280 -s webgoat

NB: 
1. Should use the python.exe in CAST AIP installation folder, for example:
    C:\Program Files\CAST\8.3\ThirdParty\Python34\python.exe
2. By default, ciareport.py would only generate 5 excel report for Impacted Objets; This means you can modify the main in ciareport.py to do more things.
